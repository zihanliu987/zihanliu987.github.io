# About Me

Hi, my name is Zihan Liu (劉子涵). I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and a Research Assistant in [Hierarchical Neural Computation Lab](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/faculty/t.asabuki/), RIKEN Center for Brain Science, under the supervision of [Dr. Toshitake Asabuki](https://sites.google.com/view/toshitake-asabuki). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I was advised by [Prof. Chi Chung Alan Fung](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/ccfung.htm).

My research interests lie in **Computational Neuroscience**, drawing on tools from theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, and dynamical systems. Specifically, I am now focusing on:

- **Neural Circuit Computation**: Understanding how neural circuits perform computations and implement cognitive functions.
- **Neural Manifold Theory**: Investigating how low-dimensional manifold structures in neural population activity give rise to perception and behavior.

# News

- *Feb, 2026*: I will be joining [Fujisawa Lab](https://fujisawalab.riken.jp/) at the University of Tokyo / RIKEN CBS as a PhD student, starting Fall 2026.
- *Dec, 2025*: I am selected for the [RIKEN Junior Research Associate (JRA)](https://www.riken.jp/en/careers/programs/jra/) Program 2026.
