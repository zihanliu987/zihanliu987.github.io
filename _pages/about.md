# About

Hi, my name is Zihan Liu (劉子涵). I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and a Research Assistant in [Hierarchical Neural Computation Lab](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/faculty/t.asabuki/), RIKEN Center for Brain Science, under the supervision of [Dr. Toshitake Asabuki](https://sites.google.com/view/toshitake-asabuki). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chi Chung Alan Fung](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/ccfung.htm).

My research interests lie in **Computational Neuroscience**. I am broadly interested in understanding how neural circuits perform computations, and how low-dimensional manifold structures in neural population activity give rise to perception and behavior. My work draws on tools from theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, and dynamical systems.
