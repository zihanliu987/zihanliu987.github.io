Hi, I'm Zihan Liu (劉子涵). I'm a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am also a Research Assistant at the [Asabuki Lab](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/faculty/t.asabuki/), RIKEN Center for Brain Science (CBS). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Chi Chung Alan Fung](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/ccfung.htm).

My research interests lie in **computational neuroscience**. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how neural circuits perform computations and how low-dimensional manifold structures in neural population activity give rise to perception and behavior. My work draws on tools from theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, and dynamical systems.
